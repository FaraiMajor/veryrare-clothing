## :hammer: Project Structure

Project consist of following stages:

- Setting up a react Router
- creating the Navigation bar
- Creating the home Page  – to display categories
- Setting up a React Context API – The Context API is a component structure provided by the React framework, which enables us to share specific states across all levels of the application. In this project, there is need to manage three states: cart (to manage the shopping cart),categories(for managing each category data)  and user (for managing the details of the currently logged in user).
- CONTEXT API code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/FaraiMajor/veryrare-clothing/tree/contextapi">contextapi branch</a> 
- Setting up payment functionality using API’s provided by Stripe(Stripe is an online payment processing and credit card processing platform for businesses.)
- Setting up a Firebase – for Handling database and authentication .Basically the database will be used to store the login information for the users, but the resource can be used for storing product information as well.
Setting up Authentication
- Transition from context api into using redux for state management using redux thunk for middleware
- I ended up switching from thunk to using redux saga for its declarative approach and advanced control flow
- REDUX code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/FaraiMajor/veryrare-clothing/tree/redux">redux branch</a> 
- Netlify for Deployement
